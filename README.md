## coworking.com - A world wide registry for cowork locations.

The idea is simple: independent professionals and those with workplace flexibility work better together than they do alone. Coworking spaces are about community-building and sustainability. Participants agree to uphold the values set forth by the movementâ€™s founders, as well as interact and share with one another. We are about creating better places to work and as a result, a better way to work.
