<h1>What is Coworking?</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
  The idea is simple: independent professionals and those with workplace
  flexibility work better together than they do alone. Coworking spaces are
  about community-building and sustainability. Participants agree to uphold
  the values set forth by the movementâ€™s founders, as well as interact and share
  with one another. We are about creating better places to work and as a result,
  a better way to work.

  If your cowork location isn't represented, reach out to any of
  our <a href="#coordinators">coordinators</a> via Twitter, and they'll
  get the ball rolling.
